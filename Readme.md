# awdware
awdware is a hobby web app project that has (or will have) various features.

## It's live!
You can visit the current state of the page [here](https://two.awdware.de/).

## Why?
Just for fun & learning and mostly for myself. However some of the current or future features actually might be useful for you, so have a look :)

## Contributing?
If you really want to contribute feel free to [contact me](mailto:rndmb0t@gmail.com).

As I do not pay for this project the number of contributors is limited, if you have a Visual Studio Subscription, this would not be a problem.
